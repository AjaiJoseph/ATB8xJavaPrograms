// 1. Write 5 points related to the Class and Objects.

//    1. Class as a Blueprint: A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods) that the objects of this class will have.
//    2. Class does not occupy memory.
//    3.Class is a group of variables of different data types and a group of methods.
//    4.A Class in Java can contain:
//             * Data member
//             * Method
//             * Constructor
//             * Nested Class
//             * Interface

//    Java Objects
//    An object in Java is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents real-life entities. Objects are the instances of a class that are created to use the attributes and methods of a class.  A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods. An object consists of :
//
//   * State : It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
//   * Behavior : It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.
//   * Identity : It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.


//   2. OOPs and Features.

//     • Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.
//    It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts (Features):
//
//    • Object
//    • Class
//    • Inheritance
//    • Polymorphism
//    • Abstraction
//    • Encapsulation
